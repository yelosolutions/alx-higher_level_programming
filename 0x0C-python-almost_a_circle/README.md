## ** Python - Almost a circle **

This project is a combination of all the concepts that I have learnt in python so far. I'm doing it in preparation for the AirBnB project which is a very big part of Higher Level Programming section of the Holberton Software Engineering curriculum. It covers:

* Import
* Exceptions
* Class
* Private attribute
* Getter/Setter
* Class method
* Static method
* Inheritance
* Unittest
* Read/Write file
* args and kwargs
* Serialization/Deserialization
* JSON

## ** General Learning Onjectives **

* What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
* How to serialize and deserialize a Class
* How to write and read a JSON file
* What is *args and how to use it
* What is **kwargs and how to use it
* How to handle named arguments in a function
