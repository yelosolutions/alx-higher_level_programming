# **0x12. JavaScript - Warm up**
---
JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. 
It was invented by Brendan Eich.

JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:
* Scripting (same as we did with Python)
* Web front-end

After, I will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery
